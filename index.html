      <h2>Marking up Text in Blocks</h2>
      <p>When you have text that is displayed in a block, it’s considered a paragraph. Paragraph text can include words or phrases that are <em>emphasized</em> or are of <strong>high importance</strong>.</p>
      <p>We can also reference element names using inline code such as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> to talk about their tags directly.</p>
      <p>Semantic tags help browsers and assistive technology understand meaning, not just appearance.</p>

      <h2>Excerpt from <cite>The Raven</cite></h2>
      <p><i>By Edgar Allan Poe</i></p>
      <p>
        Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,<br>
        Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—<br>
        While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,<br>
        As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door—<br>
        “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—<br>
        Only this and nothing more.”

      <h3>Marking Up Text to Convey Meaning</h3>
      <p>Use semantic elements to give structure and meaning to your content, grouping related ideas into logical sections.</p>
      <p>The names of HTML elements are written in angle brackets like <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>. Opening and closing tags wrap content to create elements the browser can interpret.</p>
      <p>You can draw attention to text with <b>bold</b> or highlight specific terms with <mark>highlight</mark>. For accessibility, prefer semantic emphasis: use <em>emphasis</em> for stress and <strong>importance</strong> for strong meaning; the words <mark>emphasis</mark> and <mark>importance</mark> are shown here for clarity.</p>
